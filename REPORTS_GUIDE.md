# How to Read Your Business Reports - Simple Guide

## What Are Reports For?
Reports show you how much money your business is making, what you're selling, and where your money is going. Think of it like checking your bank account, but for your whole business.

## Department Reports (For Each Store/Section)

### 1. **Total Sales** 
- This is ALL the money customers paid you
- Example: If you sold 3 items for 10,000 UGX each, Total Sales = 30,000 UGX

### 2. **Adjusted Net Sales**
- This is your sales MINUS any discounts you gave
- Example: Total Sales 30,000 UGX - Discount 2,000 UGX = Adjusted Net Sales 28,000 UGX

### 3. **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**
- This is how much YOU paid to buy the products you sold
- Example: You bought items for 15,000 UGX and sold them for 28,000 UGX
- COGS = 15,000 UGX

### 4. **COSO (Cost of Service Offered)**
- This is the cost of materials used to provide services
- Example: Haircut service needs shampoo that costs 2,000 UGX
- COSO = 2,000 UGX

### 5. **Gross Profit**
- This is Adjusted Net Sales MINUS COGS MINUS COSO
- Formula: Gross Profit = (Sales - Discounts) - (Product Costs) - (Service Material Costs)
- Example: 28,000 - 15,000 - 2,000 = 11,000 UGX Gross Profit

### 6. **Expenses**
- Money you spent on running the business (rent, electricity, salaries, etc.)
- Example: Paid 3,000 UGX for electricity

### 7. **Net Revenue (Final Profit)**
- This is what you ACTUALLY made after everything
- Formula: Net Revenue = Gross Profit - Expenses
- Example: 11,000 - 3,000 = 8,000 UGX Net Revenue
- **This is your real profit!**

### **Top 5 Services**

- "Offered" = how many times you did this service
- "Net" = actual profit after material costs

## Reconciliation Report

### What Is Reconciliation?
At the end of each day, you count the cash in your drawer and compare it with what the computer says you should have.

### **System Cash**
- This is what the computer calculated you should have (from cash sales only)
- It's automatic - based on actual sales
- Does NOT include mobile money or card payments

### **Reported Cash**
- This is the actual cash you counted in the drawer

### **Difference**
- System Cash vs Reported Cash
- **Green (0)**: Perfect! Cash matches exactly
- **Yellow (Positive number)**: Extra cash found - needs investigation (creates Suspended Revenue)
- **Red (Negative number)**: Cash missing - needs explanation

---

## Suspended Revenue

### What Is This?
When you find EXTRA cash during reconciliation that you can't explain immediately, it goes here.

### **Status Meanings**
- **Pending**: Waiting for someone to explain where the extra money came from
- **Explained**: Someone explained it, but not approved yet
- **Approved**: Admin confirmed it's real income - now added to your sales
- **Rejected**: Not real income - mistake or error

### **Why This Matters**
Only APPROVED suspended revenue counts as real income in your final reports.

## Credits Report

### What Are Credits?
Money your department borrowed from or lent to another department.

### **Credits In (You Received Money)**
- Another department gave you money
- This is SUBTRACTED from your total sales (because you have to pay it back)

### **Credits Out (You Gave Money)**
- You gave money to another department
- This is ADDED to your total sales (because they'll pay you back)

### **Settlement Status**
- **Pending**: Not paid back yet
- **Settled**: Money has been returned
- **Overdue**: Past the due date - needs attention!

## Quick Tips for Reading Reports

1. **Always check the date range** - Make sure you're looking at the right time period

2. **Focus on Net Revenue** - This is your real profit, not total sales

3. **Watch your expenses** - If expenses are too high, profit goes down

4. **Reconcile daily** - Count cash every day to catch problems early

5. **Review top items** - Stock more of what sells, less of what doesn't

6. **Approve suspended revenue quickly** - Don't let money sit unexplained

7. **Track credits carefully** - Make sure borrowed money gets paid back

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my Total Sales different from Net Revenue?**
A: Total Sales is what customers paid. Net Revenue is what you actually keep after costs and expenses.

**Q: Why doesn't my reconciliation cash match mobile money transactions?**
A: Mobile money and card payments go directly to providers, not your cash drawer. Reconciliation only checks physical cash.

**Q: What if I find missing cash?**
A: Record it in reconciliation with notes explaining what happened. Admin will review it.

**Q: When should I check reports?**
A: 
- Daily: Check reconciliation and daily sales
- Weekly: Review top products and expenses
- Monthly: Analyze overall profit and make business decisions
